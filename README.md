__API request may be limited__


The API I used is called spoonacular and this is there link "https://api.spoonacular.com/"

It's pretty nice and easy to understand, I highly recommend anybody who may want to try it out. 

I used free version and I got limmited request, which was not too bad for me.

The tools and dependency are well listed in the requirements.txt file.

Thank you for reading!
